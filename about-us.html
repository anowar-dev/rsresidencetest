Like they say, “easy to get on the Island but harder to get off.” She faced an uphill battle while completing USMLEs, enduring a lot of misinformation that added undue stress to her MATCH journey. She quickly realized that a need existed for all IMG graduates to get the proper guidance and mentorship while navigating the tiring but rewarding journey of USMLE to Residency.</p>
